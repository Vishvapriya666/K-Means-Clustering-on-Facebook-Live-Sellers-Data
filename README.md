# K-Means-Clustering-on-Facebook-Live-Sellers-Data




### Overview 
This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, on the **Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand** dataset. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI ML Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishg21/facebook-live-sellers-in-thailand-uci-ml-repo).  

Live selling, also known as **live shopping** or **live streaming commerce**, has become increasingly popular in Asian countries. This project aims to analyze sellers' behavior and segment them into clusters based on key features using K-Means Clustering.  

### **Key Features of the Project**  
✔ **Dataset**: Facebook Live Sellers dataset containing various attributes of live-streamed sales.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distribution.  
✔ **Feature Engineering**: Preprocessing and normalization techniques applied to optimize clustering results.  
✔ **K-Means Clustering**: Implementation of K-Means to segment sellers into different groups.  
✔ **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
✔ **Visualizations**: Cluster visualization using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** for insightful data representation.  

### Technologies Used 
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library for K-Means clustering  

### How to Use 
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KmeansClustering.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open and run the **Jupyter Notebook** to explore data and view clustering results.  

### Expected Outcomes 
- Identification of distinct seller groups based on clustering analysis.  
- Insights into different behavioral patterns of live sellers.  
- Potential business strategies based on seller segmentation.
